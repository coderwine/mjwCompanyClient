This page is both a practice build and potential working build for a site for the Mark J Winebrenner Company.  The base concept of this page will be so that Mark will have a functional site that his clients can visit to find out information regarding his upcoming events, seminars, blogs and other writings that within his coaching and leadership development training sessions.

v 1.0
This site should be able to allow Mark to:
    - Upload new blogs
    - Post upcoming events dynamically
        - This is so that he can generate an event and share it quickly without needed the assistance from elsewhere (outsourced/development/etc.)
    
    * This will require Mark to be able to log in to his "account" and manipulate various data.
        Backend should only need:
            Login:
                - email
                - userID
                - password
            Tables:
                - Events
                    - Date
                    - Time
                    - Title
                    - Cost
                    - Location (should include whether it will be remote)
                - Blogs
                    - Title
                    - Date
                    - IMG Link
